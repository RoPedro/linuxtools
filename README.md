# README

## DISCLAIMER: Those scripts considers a Ubuntu installation under Windows WSL2, some aspects supports native installations, but anything directory dependant, probably needs modifications.

This repository focus on installing the necessary development tools and customization to a Ubuntu enviroment. The installed packages are **completely opinionated and hardcoded for my usecase**, I'm not planning on making  it general purpose, the GitHub upload is more of a backup than anything else.
The scripts could contain errors (Especially on the retrievers scripts, I'm planning on fixing it, but not now.)
